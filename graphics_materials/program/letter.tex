Hi,

\vskip1cm

We welcome you to the 4th annual Latin American Conference on Scientific Computing with Python.
This year we will be hosting one Software Carpentry workshop for beginners,
12 tutorials, 16 talks, 80 minutes for lightning talks
and some social events that will include a scavenger hunt.

The conference will start with a 40 minutes session for lightning talks
so that attendees could show their pet projects and have three days to talk with
those that will be interested on it.
Over the course of these three days you can participate on the scavenger hunt
and try to win its prize.

We hope that you enjoy your time in Florianópolis.
The Island of Santa Catarina has 42 beaches
and in the case you don't like beaches there is one lagoon.
Try to visit the Public Market
and the Fortress of São José da Ponta Grossa.
