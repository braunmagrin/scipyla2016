Hi,

We welcome you to the 4th annual Latin American Conference on Scientific Computing with Python.
This year we will hosting one Software Carpentry workshop for beginners,
12 tutorials, 16 talks, 80 minutes for lightning talks
and some social events that includes an scavenger hunt.

The conference will start with an 40 minutes session for lightning talks
so that attendees could show their pet projects and have three days to talk with
those that will be interested on it.
On the course of the three days you can participate on the scavenger hunt
and try to win it's prize.

We hope that you enjoy your time in Florianópolis.
The Island of Santa Catarina has 42 beaches
and in the case you don't like beaches there is one lagoon.
Try to visit the Public Market
and the Fortress of São José da Ponta Grossa.
