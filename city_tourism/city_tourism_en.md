#### Public market
Do not miss this visit. The market was built next to the old Customs, in the year 1899. Besides being a busy trade center, the Public Market of Florianopolis is a meeting place for both locals and for tourists. Maybe that's why it's considered one of the most democratic places in the island, bringing together in one place artists, politicians, bohemians, businessmen and ordinary people. In the bars and restaurants you can taste various dishes of local cuisine. Built in 1848, it is one of the first places for selling fish and groceries in the ancient center of the so called Vila do Desterro, currently Florianópolis. Initially, products coming from the mainland and the neighborhoods were exposed on the beach, on the sand. Later, stalls were erected outdoors for exhibition of the goods, and finally the Public Market was built. It suffered several fires, always being rebuilt, since  after all, besides being an important trade point is a heritage of Santa Catarina Island.

#### XV de Novembro Square
On the flat  part of the land next to the sea, the pioneer Francisco Dias Velho founded in 1662, the village Nossa Senhora do Desterro. This is the place where Praça XV de Novembro is located nowadays. It was from there that the city began to expand and it is the main landmark of the Old Town with its original architecture preserved.

At Praça XV there is the monument in honor to the Heroes Killed in War of Paraguay.
With trees planted during the nineteenth century, the square received a large number of species such as royal palms, Indian ficus and carnations of India, but for sure, the highlight of the square is the century-old Figueira. It is said that it was planted in 1871 in a garden that existed in front of the parish church and was transplanted to its current location in 1891. 

Traditional, it is referred in prose and verse by the artists of the island, it is linked to a superstition which says that walking around it several times one may attract marriage and fortune. If the sympathy works or not, only testing to learn, but be sure of taking advantage of its cool shade, full of benches where retirees of the city rest and chat.

#### São José da Ponta Grossa Fortress and Praia do Forte
The fortress is really a beautiful place, which is worth knowing. It is a Portuguese fort built in 1765 which features include cannons, costumes and utensils used at the time.

Admission is only 8 reais (students pays 4 reais  and seniors are exempt). Access to the fortress however is a little complicate if you go by car. The path is a very steep climb and the road splits into two trails where two cars pass very carefully. Therefore, if you go by car it is recommended that you  leave the car down (near the last Jurerê bus stop) and walk up. If you drive up, you can go down to Praia do Forte also by car. Be careful! Sand on the track can complicate your way up, okay?

Anyway, once on the top, go around the fort, see the sun or the sunset over Praia do Forte and enjoy the historical tour and the breathtaking view you have from up there. Praia do Forte has a few restaurants "feet in the sand", so it is also good for happy hour.
